# Final Steps to Ship

## Priority 1: Core Functionality & Shipping
- [x] **Implement Tracked Fencer Management:**
  - [x] Add ability to delete individual tracked fencers.
  - [x] Add a "Clear All" button with confirmation.
- [ ] **Package for Distribution:** Create a `.zip` file of the extension and add clear, step-by-step installation instructions to `README.md`.

## Priority 2: Pre-Launch Polish
- [ ] **Audit Keyboard Accessibility:** Perform a full audit of the keyboard navigation and focus management in the modal to ensure the extension is usable without a mouse.
- [ ] **Document Key Test Scenarios:** Briefly document the main test cases (e.g., comma-names, nickname slugs, tracked list management) in `docs/testing-guide.md` to help with future maintenance.

## Deferred
- UI/UX Polish (Animations, icons, etc.)
- Advanced tracked list features (sorting, pinning)
- Search result pagination
- Detailed UX notes for documentation

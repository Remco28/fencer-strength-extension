[2025-08-26 09:00] [Gemini]: SETUP: Initialized comms directory structure and logging protocol.
[2025-10-08 11:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 2 Extension Skeleton - Setting up Manifest V3 foundation with context menu, modal injection, and mock data services
[2025-10-08 12:30] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Phase 2 Extension Skeleton complete. Delivered: manifest.json, background.js, content.js, modal.css, mock data utilities, placeholder icons, and README with testing instructions. Extension loads via "Load Unpacked" with context menu functional and modal displaying mock data across all test scenarios (single/multi/no results, multi-weapon, error states).
[2025-10-08 12:45] [CLAUDE]: Fixed bug in content.js:38-44 - currentResults now updates at start of every lookup, preventing stale back-button state when switching from multi-result to single-result queries.
[2025-10-08 13:15] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY: Phase 3 – Live Data Integration & Caching spec available at comms/tasks/2025-10-08-phase-3-data-integration.md
[2025-10-08 13:20] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 3 Live Data Integration - Implementing real API calls to fencingtracker.com with search, profile, strength, and history parsing plus 24-hour caching layer
[2025-10-08 14:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Phase 3 Live Data Integration complete. Delivered: cache module with TTL support, query normalization utilities, search API with variant fallback and retry logic, HTML parsers for profile/strength/history data, updated content.js orchestrating live API calls with concurrent request tracking, manifest configured to load all modules in correct order, updated README with live data documentation. Extension now fetches real fencer data with 24-hour caching, handles DE/Pool strength separately, displays bout statistics, and gracefully manages errors including network failures and rate limits.
[2025-10-08 15:00] [CLAUDE]: Fixed architect feedback - Added 2s retry logic with 429/5xx handling to profile.js, strength.js, and history.js fetch functions (previously only search had retry). Fixed search.js slug generation to preserve API casing (replace spaces with hyphens without lowercasing) to prevent 404s when fencingtracker expects "Lee-Kiefer" not "lee-kiefer".
[2025-10-08 15:10] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 3 Live Data Integration meets spec—live lookups with retry/backoff, slug casing preserved, documentation current.
[2025-10-08 15:30] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY: Phase 4 – UI Polish & Accessibility spec available at comms/tasks/2025-10-08-phase-4-ui-polish.md
[2025-10-09 10:45] [ARCHITECT]: IMPLEMENTATION WRAP: Completed Phase 4 name/UX updates—profile header restyle, inline bouts highlight, dynamic content script injection, structured-name normalization (suffixes, nicknames, East Asian formats), and series parser hardening. README, roadmap, planning, and next-steps docs refreshed to reflect current status.
[2025-10-09 21:11] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY: README refresh & documentation split spec available at comms/tasks/2025-10-08-readme-refresh.md
[2025-10-09 21:24] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY: Strength card emphasis & palette swap spec available at comms/tasks/2025-10-09-strength-highlight.md
[2025-10-09 23:20] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS: Strength highlight changes accepted as delivered; spec archived in comms/tasks/archive/2025-10-09-strength-highlight.md
[2025-10-08 15:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: README refresh & documentation split - Creating focused docs (development, technical-notes, testing-guide) and refactoring README for GitHub readability
[2025-10-08 16:00] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: README refresh & documentation split complete. Delivered: Concise GitHub-friendly README with tagline, streamlined features section, quick start guide, and documentation links; docs/development.md with project structure and debugging tips; docs/technical-notes.md with caching, error handling, and platform details; docs/testing-guide.md with test scenarios and validation steps; updated project-manifest.md with new doc references. All detailed technical content migrated from README to focused docs with proper cross-linking.
[2025-10-08 16:15] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Strength card emphasis & palette swap - Applying gradient accent to strength cards, muting bouts card, adding top metric badges, and implementing responsive layout
[2025-10-08 16:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Strength card emphasis & palette swap complete. Delivered: Added CSS gradient token (--fs-accent-gradient); applied vibrant gradient background to strength cards with white typography, elevated shadow, and focus outline; updated strength items with semi-transparent backgrounds and borders; split strength value/range display with dedicated .fs-strength-range styling; added top metric badge showing highest DE/Pool value per weapon; converted bouts card to muted light gradient background with dark text and softer shadow; updated label colors for accessibility; added 12px margin-top to .fs-profile-record; implemented responsive 2-column strength card layout at ≥768px with flex-wrap and 20px gap. All visual hierarchy goals met with strength ratings as hero content.
[2025-10-08 17:30] [CLAUDE]: UI refinements based on user feedback. Removed top metric badge (redundant); added "Ranges show potential skill variation" explanation label initially above strength cards; increased bout text font-weight to 600; reduced padding across sections (modal body 24px→20px, profile info 22px→18px, strength cards 18px→16px) for better space efficiency on small screens; tightened spacing between profile info and strength section (20px→16px margin); repositioned explanation label to bottom of strength section with centered alignment; moved Total Bouts from separate card to profile meta boxes alongside Club/Country/Birth Year maintaining consistent styling. Final layout: profile meta grid with 4 items, gradient strength cards, centered explanation footer.

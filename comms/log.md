[2025-08-26 09:00] [Gemini]: SETUP: Initialized comms directory structure and logging protocol.
[2025-10-08 11:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 2 Extension Skeleton - Setting up Manifest V3 foundation with context menu, modal injection, and mock data services
[2025-10-08 12:30] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Phase 2 Extension Skeleton complete. Delivered: manifest.json, background.js, content.js, modal.css, mock data utilities, placeholder icons, and README with testing instructions. Extension loads via "Load Unpacked" with context menu functional and modal displaying mock data across all test scenarios (single/multi/no results, multi-weapon, error states).
[2025-10-08 12:45] [CLAUDE]: Fixed bug in content.js:38-44 - currentResults now updates at start of every lookup, preventing stale back-button state when switching from multi-result to single-result queries.
[2025-10-08 13:15] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY: Phase 3 – Live Data Integration & Caching spec available at comms/tasks/2025-10-08-phase-3-data-integration.md
[2025-10-08 13:20] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 3 Live Data Integration - Implementing real API calls to fencingtracker.com with search, profile, strength, and history parsing plus 24-hour caching layer
[2025-10-08 14:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Phase 3 Live Data Integration complete. Delivered: cache module with TTL support, query normalization utilities, search API with variant fallback and retry logic, HTML parsers for profile/strength/history data, updated content.js orchestrating live API calls with concurrent request tracking, manifest configured to load all modules in correct order, updated README with live data documentation. Extension now fetches real fencer data with 24-hour caching, handles DE/Pool strength separately, displays bout statistics, and gracefully manages errors including network failures and rate limits.
[2025-10-08 15:00] [CLAUDE]: Fixed architect feedback - Added 2s retry logic with 429/5xx handling to profile.js, strength.js, and history.js fetch functions (previously only search had retry). Fixed search.js slug generation to preserve API casing (replace spaces with hyphens without lowercasing) to prevent 404s when fencingtracker expects "Lee-Kiefer" not "lee-kiefer".
[2025-10-08 15:10] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 3 Live Data Integration meets spec—live lookups with retry/backoff, slug casing preserved, documentation current.
[2025-10-08 15:30] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY: Phase 4 – UI Polish & Accessibility spec available at comms/tasks/2025-10-08-phase-4-ui-polish.md
[2025-10-09 10:45] [ARCHITECT]: IMPLEMENTATION WRAP: Completed Phase 4 name/UX updates—profile header restyle, inline bouts highlight, dynamic content script injection, structured-name normalization (suffixes, nicknames, East Asian formats), and series parser hardening. README, roadmap, planning, and next-steps docs refreshed to reflect current status.
[2025-10-09 21:11] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY: README refresh & documentation split spec available at comms/tasks/2025-10-08-readme-refresh.md
[2025-10-09 21:24] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY: Strength card emphasis & palette swap spec available at comms/tasks/2025-10-09-strength-highlight.md
[2025-10-09 23:20] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS: Strength highlight changes accepted as delivered; spec archived in comms/tasks/archive/2025-10-09-strength-highlight.md
[2025-10-08 15:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: README refresh & documentation split - Creating focused docs (development, technical-notes, testing-guide) and refactoring README for GitHub readability
[2025-10-08 16:00] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: README refresh & documentation split complete. Delivered: Concise GitHub-friendly README with tagline, streamlined features section, quick start guide, and documentation links; docs/development.md with project structure and debugging tips; docs/technical-notes.md with caching, error handling, and platform details; docs/testing-guide.md with test scenarios and validation steps; updated project-manifest.md with new doc references. All detailed technical content migrated from README to focused docs with proper cross-linking.
[2025-10-08 16:15] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Strength card emphasis & palette swap - Applying gradient accent to strength cards, muting bouts card, adding top metric badges, and implementing responsive layout
[2025-10-08 16:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Strength card emphasis & palette swap complete. Delivered: Added CSS gradient token (--fs-accent-gradient); applied vibrant gradient background to strength cards with white typography, elevated shadow, and focus outline; updated strength items with semi-transparent backgrounds and borders; split strength value/range display with dedicated .fs-strength-range styling; added top metric badge showing highest DE/Pool value per weapon; converted bouts card to muted light gradient background with dark text and softer shadow; updated label colors for accessibility; added 12px margin-top to .fs-profile-record; implemented responsive 2-column strength card layout at ≥768px with flex-wrap and 20px gap. All visual hierarchy goals met with strength ratings as hero content.
[2025-10-08 17:30] [CLAUDE]: UI refinements based on user feedback. Removed top metric badge (redundant); added "Ranges show potential skill variation" explanation label initially above strength cards; increased bout text font-weight to 600; reduced padding across sections (modal body 24px→20px, profile info 22px→18px, strength cards 18px→16px) for better space efficiency on small screens; tightened spacing between profile info and strength section (20px→16px margin); repositioned explanation label to bottom of strength section with centered alignment; moved Total Bouts from separate card to profile meta boxes alongside Club/Country/Birth Year maintaining consistent styling. Final layout: profile meta grid with 4 items, gradient strength cards, centered explanation footer.
[2025-10-09 21:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Modal Visual Refresh - Implementing fencingtracker.com font parity, tighter spacing in strength cards, sharper corner radii, and design tokens per comms/tasks/2025-10-09-modal-visual-refresh.md
[2025-10-09 22:00] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Modal Visual Refresh complete. Delivered: Inter font (weights 400, 500, 600) downloaded and configured with @font-face declarations; design tokens added for font stack (--fs-font-sans), radii (--fs-radius-card/item/button), and tight spacing (--fs-spacing-tight); all hard-coded border-radius values replaced with tokens throughout modal.css; reduced spacing in strength cards (gap 8px→6px, item padding 10px 14px→8px 12px, weapon name margin-bottom 12px→10px); added responsive breakpoint for ≤375px with tighter padding; manifest.json updated with web_accessible_resources for fonts; comms/visual_design.md documentation created detailing typography, tokens, spacing philosophy, and alignment with fencingtracker.com. Modal now features sharper 6-8px radii (down from 10-12px), tighter vertical spacing for denser information display, and Inter font matching fencingtracker.com's visual language.
[2025-10-09 22:30] [CLAUDE]: UI refinements based on user feedback. Changed strength item layout from space-between to flex-start with 8px gap for tighter label-to-value spacing; added min-width 42px to strength labels for vertical alignment of DE/Pool values; converted strength cards layout from flexbox to CSS Grid (repeat(auto-fit, minmax(220px, 1fr))) for compact multi-weapon display with automatic 2-column layout (3 weapons: 2 top, 1 bottom); increased grid gap from 12px→16px to prevent card/shadow overlap; implemented weapon-specific gradient colors with design tokens (--fs-gradient-foil green, --fs-gradient-epee blue, --fs-gradient-sabre red/orange); added weapon class to cards (fs-weapon-foil/epee/saber) with CSS handling both 'epee' and 'épée' spellings; updated explanation label to use grid-column: 1 / -1 for full-width spanning; added responsive breakpoint at ≤520px for single-column card layout. Final result: compact, color-coded weapon cards with aligned scores and intelligent grid wrapping.
[2025-10-09 19:02] [ARCHITECT]: IMPL DONE: Tracked fencer feature delivered. Added star toggle with storage persistence, tracked list modal, and toolbar popup trigger. Background script now injects content on demand and tolerates silent responses. Latest iteration converts tracked view to compact text list with auto-resized modal and removes redundant heading copy. Docs updated: comms/tracked_fencers.md storage schema note, comms/visual_design.md tracked-list styling, popup/manifest versions, new assets documented.
[2025-10-09 23:30] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 1 Background API Prep - Loading network/cache helpers in background service worker via importScripts to prepare for CORS refactor without changing content script behavior
[2025-10-09 23:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Phase 1 Background API Prep complete. Delivered: importScripts calls for all helper modules (base-url, cache, normalize, search, profile, strength, history) at top of background.js; buildBackgroundApi() function that validates all required functions exist (searchFencers, getProfile, getStrength, getHistory, purgeExpired) and constructs namespaced API object; getBackgroundApi() helper for future phase access; self.fsApi global attached to service worker with error handling; comprehensive inline documentation explaining Phase 1 purpose and Phase 2 roadmap. Background service worker now owns API helpers while content script flow remains unchanged per spec. Ready for validation testing.
[2025-10-10 00:00] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 2 Background Messaging Bridge - Moving all cross-origin API execution to background service worker by removing helper scripts from page context and creating structured message bridge between content.js and background.js
[2025-10-10 00:15] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Phase 2 Background Messaging Bridge complete. Delivered: Updated manifest.json to load only content.js (removed all helper scripts from content_scripts array); updated CONTENT_SCRIPT_FILES in background.js to match manifest; added handleBackgroundApiCall function in background.js with validation, error handling, and smart logging (suppresses user-facing 404s); integrated fsCallBackgroundApi message handler into existing runtime.onMessage listener; created callBackgroundApi helper in content.js wrapping chrome.runtime.sendMessage with proper error handling; replaced all direct API calls (searchFencers, getProfile, getStrength, getHistory, purgeExpired) with message bridge delegation; updated createProfileUrl to use hardcoded base URL since global is no longer available. Content script now has zero fetch calls - all cross-origin requests execute in background service worker. Existing flows (context menu, tracked fencers, cache purge) preserved via message passing. Ready for validation testing.
[2025-10-10 00:30] [CLAUDE]: Fixed base URL regression per architect feedback. Added getBaseUrl function to background API surface (background.js:46) that returns configured FENCINGTRACKER_BASE_URL; created fetchAndCacheBaseUrl helper in content.js (line 1019) that retrieves base URL via message bridge and caches in globalThis._fsBaseUrlCache; updated createProfileUrl (line 992) to accept optional baseUrl parameter and fall back to cached value via getCachedBaseUrl; called fetchAndCacheBaseUrl opportunistically on each lookup (content.js:96) to ensure cache stays fresh. Profile URLs now respect configured environment - if base URL points to staging, both API calls and user-facing links will use staging host consistently.
[2025-10-10 00:45] [CLAUDE]: Fixed tracked-list base URL cache miss per architect feedback. Added await fetchAndCacheBaseUrl() call in showTrackedFencerList (content.js:637) before rendering tracked fencer links. Previously only handleLookup fetched base URL, so opening tracked list from popup on fresh tab would fall back to hardcoded production URL even when FENCINGTRACKER_BASE_URL pointed to staging. Now both lookup flow and tracked-list flow ensure base URL cache is populated before createProfileUrl builds any links.
[2025-10-10 01:00] [CLAUDE]: CRITICAL FIX - DOMParser not available in service workers. Split fetch/parse responsibilities: background worker fetches raw HTML (CORS-safe), content script parses HTML (DOMParser available). Changes: Created fetchProfileHtml, fetchStrengthHtml, fetchHistoryHtml functions in profile.js, strength.js, history.js (lines 47, 34, 34 respectively) that return {html} instead of parsed data; updated background API surface to expose HTML fetchers plus cache utilities (getCached, setCached, cache key generators) and createSlug helper; moved all DOMParser-dependent parsing functions to content.js (lines 57-427): parseProfileHtml, parseStrengthHtml, parseHistoryHtml plus all helpers (parseSlug, normalizeWeapon, parseStrengthValue/Range, parseSeriesData, parseJsObjectLiteral, parseStatValue, findWinLossTable, getAllTimeColumnIndex); updated showProfileView (content.js:700-726) to fetch HTML from background then parse locally. Architecture now cleanly separates concerns: background handles network/CORS, content script handles HTML parsing with DOMParser.
[2025-10-10 01:15] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Cache restoration & slug fallback fix - Reintroducing 24-hour caching layer and slug regeneration logic lost in DOMParser refactor
[2025-10-10 01:30] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Cache restoration & slug fallback fix complete. Changes: Updated getProfile, getStrength, getHistory in profile.js, strength.js, history.js to wrap fetchHtml functions with 24-hour caching layer (check cache first, fetch if miss, store result); restored slug fallback logic in getProfile (lines 29-36) that regenerates slug from fallbackName and retries on 404; updated background API surface (background.js:43-46) to expose getProfile/getStrength/getHistory instead of raw fetch functions; updated content.js:701,705,709 to call cached wrapper functions (getProfile with fallbackName parameter, getStrength, getHistory) instead of fetchProfileHtml/fetchStrengthHtml/fetchHistoryHtml. Architecture now maintains 24-hour cache per fencer ID, reducing network hits and rate limit exposure, while preserving slug regeneration behavior when profiles are moved.
[2025-10-10 02:05] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Slug regression hotfix - Restoring mixed-case/diacritic-preserving slug generation and ensuring fallback slugs propagate through cached profile results
[2025-10-10 02:25] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Slug regression hotfix in place. Updated createSlug (src/utils/normalize.js) to keep Unicode letters and casing while stripping punctuation, and tightened fallback path in getProfile (src/api/profile.js) to return/cache regenerated slugs so downstream profile URLs reflect fencingtracker’s canonical casing.
[2025-10-10 02:40] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Slug nickname preservation fix - Allowing parentheses through createSlug and wiring nickname ordering in buildSlugFromName
[2025-10-10 02:55] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Nickname slug preservation complete. createSlug now keeps nickname parentheses while still collapsing unsupported punctuation, buildSlugFromName assembles \"First (Nickname) Last\" before slugging (suffix aware), and surname detection handles two-letter uppercase surnames like \"LI\" so fallback retries hit fencingtracker’s canonical URL.
[2025-10-11 09:05] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY: Comma-name variant repairs documented at comms/tasks/2025-10-11-comma-name-variants.md
[2025-10-11 14:20] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Updating structured name parsing and variant emission per 2025-10-11 comma-name variants spec.
[2025-10-11 15:05] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Comma-name variant fixes delivered; structured parsing honors leading surnames and variant builder adds first-name fallbacks, hyphenated slug searches, plus regression tests/docs updates.
[2025-10-11 10:20] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS: Comma-name variant repairs accepted after doc URL update; spec archived to comms/tasks/archive/2025-10-11-comma-name-variants.md

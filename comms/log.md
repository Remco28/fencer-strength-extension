[2025-10-08 11:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 2 Extension Skeleton - Setting up Manifest V3 foundation with context menu, modal injection, and mock data services
[2025-10-08 12:30] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Phase 2 Extension Skeleton complete. Delivered: manifest.json, background.js, content.js, modal.css, mock data utilities, placeholder icons, and README with testing instructions. Extension loads via "Load Unpacked" with context menu functional and modal displaying mock data across all test scenarios (single/multi/no results, multi-weapon, error states).
[2025-10-08 12:45] [CLAUDE]: Fixed bug in content.js:38-44 - currentResults now updates at start of every lookup, preventing stale back-button state when switching from multi-result to single-result queries.
[2025-10-08 13:15] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY: Phase 3 – Live Data Integration & Caching spec available at comms/tasks/2025-10-08-phase-3-data-integration.md
[2025-10-08 13:20] [CLAUDE]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Phase 3 Live Data Integration - Implementing real API calls to fencingtracker.com with search, profile, strength, and history parsing plus 24-hour caching layer
[2025-10-08 14:45] [CLAUDE]: IMPL DONE: Phase 3 Live Data Integration complete. Delivered: cache module with TTL support, query normalization utilities, search API with variant fallback and retry logic, HTML parsers for profile/strength/history data, updated content.js orchestrating live API calls with concurrent request tracking, manifest configured to load all modules in correct order, updated README with live data documentation. Extension now fetches real fencer data with 24-hour caching, handles DE/Pool strength separately, displays bout statistics, and gracefully manages errors including network failures and rate limits.
[2025-10-08 15:00] [CLAUDE]: Fixed architect feedback - Added 2s retry logic with 429/5xx handling to profile.js, strength.js, and history.js fetch functions (previously only search had retry). Fixed search.js slug generation to preserve API casing (replace spaces with hyphens without lowercasing) to prevent 404s when fencingtracker expects "Lee-Kiefer" not "lee-kiefer".
[2025-10-08 15:10] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS: Phase 3 Live Data Integration meets spec—live lookups with retry/backoff, slug casing preserved, documentation current.
